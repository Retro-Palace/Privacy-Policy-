Privacy Policy
Last Updated: June 4, 2025

Frexo ("the Bot") is a Discord bot developed to provide entertainment and utility features within Discord servers. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data.

1. Data We Collect

Frexo may collect and store the following data:

User ID, Server ID, Channel ID – used to identify users, servers, and channels for feature tracking and functionality.

Command usage data – used to provide bot features, maintain user state (e.g., economy, games), and improve the experience.

Message content (limited use only) – message content is only accessed in specific features (such as counting games or message deletion logging), and is never stored persistently

Economy/game progress and preferences – stored to track user engagement and progress within the bot's systems.

We do not collect or store personal information such as email addresses, passwords, or any third-party service credentials.

2. How We Use Your Data

We use your data to:

Provide bot features (games, economy, utility tools)

Maintain state across commands and sessions

Improve features through usage insights

Enforce abuse prevention measures

3. Message Content Usage
Voxel may read message content in limited and clearly defined scenarios:

To validate game actions (e.g., counting games)

To log deleted messages when configured by a server admin

Message content is never stored long-term, indexed, or analyzed outside of these specific, opt-in features. If a message must be logged (e.g., for moderation), it is only retained temporarily and only in servers where the logging feature is enabled by server administrators.

4. Data Sharing
We do not sell or share any user data with third parties. Data is only accessible to Voxel developers for debugging, support, or feature development when necessary.

5. Data Retention
Economy and gameplay data is stored until the user requests removal.

Temporary logs (e.g., donations, wins/losses, or deleted messages) may be retained for up to 60 days for transparency or troubleshooting.

Message content is not stored, except briefly and only when required for a feature the server has explicitly enabled.

6. Your Rights
You may request full deletion of your data (including economy, gameplay, and any logs) by contacting us.

You also have the right to opt out of any data being stored. To do so, simply contact us and provide your Discord user ID. Once processed, all existing data will be removed, and no future data will be retained for your user ID.

We will comply with any data removal requests within a reasonable time frame.
